  ### :palm_tree: Data Analysis and Visualization
  
  * [Data Analysis and Visualisation on E-Commerce Dataset](https://github.com/mazqoty/Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-on-Ecommerce-Dataset)
  This is the largest retail e-commerce orders dataset from Pakistan. It contains half a million transaction records from March 2016 to August 2018. The data was collected from   various e-commerce merchants as part of a research study. Further details can be found on the following link 
  https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/pakistans-largest-ecommerce-dataset
  
 ### :palm_tree: Machine Learning

* [Convlutional Neural Network](https://github.com/mazqoty/malaria_detection) In this exercise, the CNN model predicts where an uploaded image of cell is infected/uninfected from malaria bectaria. This is also deployed on streamlit. [Check this app on Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/mazqoty/malaria_detection/main/app.py). The Dataset is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/

* [CNN_CIFAR100](https://github.com/mazqoty/CNN_CIFAR100) The objective of this project is study and build a convolutional neural network model that can correctly recognize and classify colored images of objects into one of the 100 available classes for CIFAR-100 dataset.
This Dataset is taken from Kaggle/Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 datasets: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

### :palm_tree: Web Scraping

* [Web Scraping Ecommerce Website](https://github.com/mazqoty/Scraping-Carrefour-E-commerce) Over 5K product data scraped from Carrefour including Images.
* [Web Scraping Ecommerce Website](https://github.com/mazqoty/Scraping-Lulu-Hypermarket-E-commerce) Over 10K products data scraped from Lu-Lu Hypermarket. It also includes   images of the products.
* [Web Scraping Real State Website](https://github.com/mazqoty/Scraping-Zameen.com) It's the big real state web site. I scraped more than 100k of product data.
### :palm_tree: Natural Language Processing

* [ Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/mazqoty/sentiment_Analyzer) This small program access the sentiments in the given sentences.

### :palm_tree: Others
* [Bulk Image Downloader](https://github.com/mazqoty/dicom_jpg_resize) It downloads the images in bulk. Image httpS links to be provided in .xls file.
  [Docker Repo Pull](https://hub.docker.com/r/mazqoty/image_downloader)

* [DICOM Image Resize](https://github.com/mazqoty/Image-Downloader) It converts .dcm to .png and resize them.
  

## Front End Web Development, ReactJS

  ### :palm_tree: HTML, CSS, Java Script
  
  * These are small pieces of codes consists of HTML, CSS and pure JS

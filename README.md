# Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects and data engineering projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Python Scripts and Jupyter Notebooks.

Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration and educational purposes only.

## Front End Web Development, ReactJS

  ## Data Science

  ### :palm_tree: Data Analysis and Visualization
  
  * [Data Analysis and Visualisation on E-Commerce Dataset](https://github.com/mazqoty/Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-on-Ecommerce-Dataset)
  This is the largest retail e-commerce orders dataset from Pakistan. It contains half a million transaction records from March 2016 to August 2018. The data was collected from   various e-commerce merchants as part of a research study. Further details can be found on the following link 
  https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/pakistans-largest-ecommerce-dataset
  
 ### :palm_tree: Machine Learning

* [Convlutional Neural Network](https://github.com/mazqoty/malaria_detection) In this exercise, the CNN model predicts where an uploaded image of cell is infected/uninfected from malaria bectaria. This is also deployed on streamlit. [Check this app on Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/mazqoty/malaria_detection/main/app.py). The Dataset is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/

* [CNN_CIFAR100](https://github.com/mazqoty/CNN_CIFAR100) The objective of this project is study and build a convolutional neural network model that can correctly recognize and classify colored images of objects into one of the 100 available classes for CIFAR-100 dataset.
This Dataset is taken from Kaggle/Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 datasets: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

### :palm_tree: Web Scraping

* [Web Scraping Ecommerce Website](https://github.com/mazqoty/Scraping-Carrefour-E-commerce) Over 5K product data scraped from Carrefour including Images.
* [Web Scraping Ecommerce Website](https://github.com/mazqoty/Scraping-Lulu-Hypermarket-E-commerce) Over 10K products data scraped from Lu-Lu Hypermarket. It also includes   images of the products.
* [Web Scraping Real State Website](https://github.com/mazqoty/Scraping-Zameen.com) It's the big real state web site. I scraped more than 100k of product data.
### :palm_tree: Natural Language Processing

* [ Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/mazqoty/sentiment_Analyzer) This small program access the sentiments in the given sentences.

### :palm_tree: Others
* [Bulk Image Downloader](https://github.com/mazqoty/Image-Downloader) It downloads the images in bulk. Image httpS links to be provided in .xls file.
  [Docker Repo Pull](https://hub.docker.com/r/mazqoty/image_downloader)
